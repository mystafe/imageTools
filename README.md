This repository contains a simple React application for converting images to PNG, SVG and ICO formats.

The app lets you:

- HEIC images are automatically converted for preview
- Choose a resolution for the output
- Download the current image as PNG, JPG, SVG or ICO
- Generate and copy the SVG code to the clipboard
- Download React asset files as a zip containing logo512.png, logo192.png, favicon.ico and logo.svg
- Combine all uploaded images into a single PDF file
- Specify the output file name
- Convert uploaded videos to different resolutions using built-in presets and quality options

The React app is located in the `frontend` directory and was created using Vite.
